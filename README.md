# Jake — Your AI Job Search Coach That Remembers Your Entire Career

> ⚠️ **DRAFT** — This specialist was created on Feb 17, 2026 and has not yet been manually reviewed. Content, structure, and instructions may change.

Every career tool gives generic advice. Jake knows **your story** — your experience, your target roles, every application you've submitted, and every interview you've debriefed. He builds a search strategy that gets sharper every session because he never forgets where you are.

## The Problem

You ask an AI to review your resume. It gives decent generic feedback. Then you ask it to prep you for an interview — it has no idea what's on your resume, what role you applied for, or that you already bombed this same question last week. You re-explain everything. Every. Single. Time.

**Jake fixes this.**

## What Jake Does

📄 **Resume Tailoring** — Not just feedback — Jake rewrites bullets using your actual achievements, quantified and targeted to each specific role

🎯 **Strategic Job Search** — Quality over quantity. Jake helps you target the right roles, companies, and channels based on your profile and preferences

🎤 **Interview Prep** — Company-specific research, STAR story practice, and mock questions tailored to the role and your experience

📊 **Pipeline Tracking** — Every application, interview, and follow-up tracked across your entire search. Nothing falls through the cracks.

💰 **Salary Negotiation** — Market research, counter-offer strategy, and total comp optimization based on your specific situation

🤝 **Networking Strategy** — Informational interview coaching, LinkedIn optimization, and relationship tracking

## How It Works

Jake is an **AI Specialist** built on [Magic Context](https://magiccontext.ai). Instead of starting every AI conversation from scratch, Jake maintains a persistent workspace — your career profile, application history, interview experiences, and networking contacts — that carries across every session.

### The Magic Context Difference

Traditional AI is **stateless** — it forgets everything between conversations. Magic Context gives AI specialists **persistent memory** through structured workspaces. This means:

- **Session 1:** Jake learns your career story, skills, and what you're looking for
- **Session 5:** Jake tailors your resume for a specific role, referencing achievements from three jobs ago
- **Session 20:** Jake notices you get callbacks from startups but not enterprise companies, and adjusts targeting
- **Session 50+:** Jake knows your interview patterns, your negotiation style, and which companies would be the best fit

**Your context is yours.** It's stored as plain markdown files you can read, edit, or export anytime. No black box. No vendor lock-in.
