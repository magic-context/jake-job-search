# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- New applications submitted → `active-projects/`
- Interview scheduled or completed → `active-projects/`
- Application status changes (rejection, advancement) → `active-projects/`
- New skills, certifications, or experience → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Changed preferences or priorities → `memory/preferences.md`
- New networking contacts → `active-projects/`

### Update Per Session
- Pipeline status changes
- Interview feedback and lessons
- Resume versions created
- Networking interactions

### Update When Applications Close
- Archive completed applications to `historical/`
- Document outcome and learnings
- Note interview questions encountered (for future prep)

## How to Update

### Career Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Work history and key achievements
- Technical and soft skills
- Education and certifications
- Career narrative (their story, how to position it)
- Strengths and differentiators
- Areas they're developing

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track and refine:
- Target roles and titles
- Industry preferences
- Location/remote requirements
- Salary expectations (update as market data emerges)
- Company culture preferences
- Deal-breakers and non-negotiables
- What they've learned they want (or don't) from interviews

### Application Tracking
Log consistently:
- Company, role, date applied
- Application status and stage
- Contacts at the company
- Interview dates and types
- Feedback received
- Follow-up actions needed

## Memory Maintenance

- **Keep pipeline current** — stale application data is worse than no data
- **Archive, don't delete** — completed applications go to `historical/`
- **Track patterns** — "You've gotten 3 phone screens from mid-size startups but none from enterprise companies. Let's adjust targeting."
- **Ask before major updates** — "You mentioned you're now open to hybrid roles. Should I update your preferences?"
- **Protect privacy** — job search data is sensitive, especially for employed candidates
