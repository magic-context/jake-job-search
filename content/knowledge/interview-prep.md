# Interview Preparation

## Interview Types

### Phone Screen (20-30 min)
- Usually with a recruiter
- Purpose: verify basics (experience, salary, availability, interest)
- Prep: know your pitch, salary range, and why this company
- Have your resume in front of you

### Behavioral Interview (45-60 min)
- Hiring manager or team members
- Purpose: assess culture fit, leadership, problem-solving
- Prep: 8-10 STAR stories covering key competencies
- This is where most candidates are made or broken

### Technical Interview (45-90 min)
- Varies by field: coding, case studies, portfolio review, skills assessment
- Purpose: verify you can do the work
- Prep: practice relevant skills, review fundamentals, prepare examples

### Panel Interview (60 min)
- Multiple interviewers simultaneously
- Prep: make eye contact with everyone, address the questioner but include the group
- Get all their names and roles beforehand if possible

### Executive/Final Round
- Senior leadership, often cultural and strategic fit
- Prep: think big picture — vision, values, long-term impact
- This is as much about you evaluating them as them evaluating you

## The STAR Method

For behavioral questions, structure every answer:

- **Situation:** Set the context (1-2 sentences)
- **Task:** What was your responsibility? What needed to happen?
- **Action:** What did YOU specifically do? (This is the longest part)
- **Result:** What happened? Quantify if possible.

### Example
**Q: "Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult stakeholder."**

- **S:** "At Acme, our VP of Sales wanted to rush a feature that our data showed would hurt retention."
- **T:** "I needed to redirect the conversation toward data-driven prioritization without alienating a key stakeholder."
- **A:** "I scheduled a 1:1, acknowledged his perspective, then walked through the retention data and proposed a phased approach that addressed his core need — faster deal closing — without the retention risk."
- **R:** "He agreed to the phased approach. We shipped Phase 1 in 6 weeks, deal velocity improved 15%, and retention stayed flat. He became one of my strongest advocates for data-driven planning."

## Common Behavioral Questions

### Leadership
- Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult situation
- Describe a time you had to make an unpopular decision
- How do you handle underperforming team members?

### Problem-Solving
- Tell me about the most complex problem you've solved
- Describe a time you had to make a decision with incomplete information
- How do you approach a problem you've never seen before?

### Collaboration
- Tell me about a cross-functional project you led
- Describe a conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it
- How do you build trust with a new team?

### Failure & Growth
- Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn?
- Describe a project that didn't go as planned
- What's the biggest mistake you've made professionally?

### Motivation
- Why are you leaving your current role?
- Why this company? Why this role?
- Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?

## Questions to Ask Them

### About the Role
- "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
- "What's the biggest challenge facing this team right now?"
- "How is performance measured for this role?"

### About the Team
- "How would you describe the team culture?"
- "What's the team's biggest strength? Biggest gap?"
- "How does the team handle disagreements?"

### About the Company
- "What's the company's biggest priority this year?"
- "How does this team contribute to that priority?"
- "What's something you wish you'd known before joining?"

**Red flag questions (for your evaluation):**
- "How is work-life balance here?" (listen for hedging)
- "Why is this position open?" (growth vs. turnover)
- "What's the decision timeline?" (gauge urgency and process)
