# Resume Best Practices

## Formatting

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Rules
- **Simple formatting** — no tables, columns, text boxes, or headers/footers
- **Standard fonts** — Arial, Calibri, Garamond, Times New Roman (10-12pt)
- **Standard sections** — Experience, Education, Skills, clearly labeled
- **File format** — PDF unless they specifically ask for .docx
- **.docx backup** — some ATS parse .docx better than PDF; have both ready
- **No images or graphics** — ATS can't read them

### Layout
- **Contact info** at the top: name, email, phone, LinkedIn, location (city/state only)
- **Experience** in reverse chronological order
- **One page** for <10 years experience; two pages max
- **Consistent formatting** — same bullet style, date format, spacing throughout
- **White space** — don't cram. Readability matters.

## Writing Bullets

### The Formula
**[Action verb] + [What you did] + [Impact/Result with numbers]**

### Examples
❌ "Responsible for managing the sales team"
✅ "Led 12-person sales team to exceed quarterly targets by 23%, generating $2.4M in new revenue"

❌ "Helped improve customer satisfaction"
✅ "Redesigned onboarding flow, improving customer satisfaction scores from 72 to 91 (NPS) across 2,000+ accounts"

❌ "Worked on various projects"
✅ "Delivered 5 cross-functional product launches on time, coordinating 3 engineering teams and 2 external vendors"

### Strong Action Verbs
| Category | Verbs |
|----------|-------|
| **Leadership** | Led, Directed, Managed, Spearheaded, Championed |
| **Building** | Built, Created, Designed, Developed, Launched |
| **Improving** | Optimized, Streamlined, Reduced, Increased, Accelerated |
| **Analyzing** | Analyzed, Identified, Evaluated, Assessed, Researched |
| **Collaborating** | Partnered, Coordinated, Facilitated, Mentored, Aligned |

### Quantify Everything
- Revenue: "$X generated/saved"
- Scale: "X users/customers/transactions"
- Speed: "reduced from X to Y days/hours"
- Growth: "X% increase/decrease"
- Team: "managed X people across Y teams"

**If you can't quantify, qualify:** "largest client," "first-ever," "company-wide"

## Tailoring

### For Each Application
1. Read the job description carefully
2. Identify their top 3-5 priorities
3. Reorder and reword your bullets to match their language
4. Mirror their keywords (ATS matches exact terms)
5. Move most relevant experience to the top of each role

### Keywords
- Extract keywords from the job posting
- Include them naturally in your experience bullets
- Match their terminology: if they say "stakeholder management," use that phrase, not "working with people"

## Sections

### Summary (Optional)
- 2-3 sentences, only if it adds value
- Best for career changers or senior roles
- Worst when it's generic ("Results-driven professional seeking...")
- Good: "Product manager with 8 years in fintech, specializing in payment systems and API platform products. Led teams of 5-15 across 3 product lines at Series B-D companies."

### Skills Section
- Technical skills, tools, certifications
- Match the job posting's requirements
- Don't list soft skills here (show them in experience bullets)
- Group logically: Languages, Frameworks, Tools, Certifications

### Education
- Recent grads: near the top, include GPA if >3.5, relevant coursework
- Experienced professionals: bottom of page, just degree/school/year
- Don't include high school

## Common Resume Mistakes
1. **Generic bullets** — "Responsible for..." tells nothing about impact
2. **No numbers** — unquantified achievements are forgettable
3. **One resume for all applications** — tailoring is non-negotiable
4. **Objective statement** — outdated. Use a summary or skip it.
5. **Including everything** — relevance > completeness. Cut the noise.
6. **Typos** — one typo can kill an application. Proofread. Then proofread again.
7. **Fancy formatting** — creative fields excepted, keep it clean and ATS-friendly
