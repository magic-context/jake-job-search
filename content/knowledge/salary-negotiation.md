# Salary Negotiation

## Core Principles

1. **You have the most leverage between offer and acceptance** — use it
2. **Negotiating is expected** — companies budget for it. Not negotiating leaves money on the table.
3. **Total compensation > base salary** — look at the full package
4. **Never give a number first** if you can avoid it
5. **Get everything in writing** before accepting

## Before Negotiation

### Research Market Rates
- **Levels.fyi** — tech compensation data (excellent)
- **Glassdoor** — salary ranges by company and role
- **LinkedIn Salary** — market data by role and location
- **Blind** — anonymous salary sharing (tech-heavy)
- **Payscale / Salary.com** — broad market data
- **Recruiter conversations** — ask "What's the range for this role?"

### Know Your Number
- **Target:** What you want (based on market data + your experience)
- **Walk-away:** The minimum you'd accept
- **Anchor:** Your opening ask (10-20% above target for negotiation room)
- Factor in: location, remote vs. onsite, cost of living, career growth

### Total Compensation Components
| Component | Negotiable? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Base salary | Yes | Most straightforward to negotiate |
| Signing bonus | Yes | One-time, easier for companies to approve |
| Annual bonus | Sometimes | Often tied to company/role level bands |
| Equity (RSUs/options) | Yes | Can be significant, especially at startups |
| PTO / Vacation | Sometimes | More flexible at smaller companies |
| Remote work | Sometimes | Huge quality-of-life factor |
| Start date | Yes | Can negotiate more time |
| Relocation | Yes | If applicable, ask for a package |
| Title | Sometimes | Can affect future earning potential |
| Professional development | Yes | Conference budget, education stipend |

## The Negotiation Conversation

### When They Ask "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

**Option 1: Deflect (preferred early in process)**
> "I'm flexible on compensation and more focused on finding the right role. I'd love to learn more about the position first. What's the budgeted range for this role?"

**Option 2: Give a range (if pressed)**
> "Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting $X-$Y for this type of role. But I'm open to discussing total compensation."

Set the bottom of your range at your target, not your minimum.

### When You Receive an Offer

1. **Express enthusiasm** — "Thank you! I'm really excited about this opportunity."
2. **Don't accept immediately** — "I'd like to take a day to review the full package."
3. **Ask for the offer in writing** — email or official letter
4. **Review everything** — base, bonus, equity, benefits, PTO, start date

### Making a Counter-Offer

> "Thank you for the offer — I'm genuinely excited about this role and the team. After reviewing the package and considering my [experience/market research/competing offers], I was hoping we could discuss the base salary. I was targeting $X, given [specific justification]. Is there flexibility there?"

**Justification options:**
- Market data for the role
- Your specific experience and impact
- Competing offers (if you have them — don't bluff)
- Cost of living (if relocating)

### If They Can't Move on Base
> "I understand base salary may be fixed. Would you be open to discussing [signing bonus / additional equity / extra PTO / remote flexibility / title adjustment]?"

**Always have a backup ask.** If they can't give you more cash, what else has value?

## Negotiation Mistakes

1. **Not negotiating at all** — the biggest mistake. They expect it.
2. **Apologizing for negotiating** — you're not being difficult; you're advocating for yourself
3. **Bluffing about competing offers** — if they call your bluff, you lose credibility
4. **Focusing only on base salary** — total comp matters more
5. **Accepting verbally then trying to negotiate** — negotiate before accepting
6. **Being adversarial** — this is a collaboration, not a battle. You're about to work together.
7. **Negotiating over email when a call would work better** — nuance matters

## Post-Negotiation

- Get the final offer in writing
- Review all details before signing
- Ask about onboarding, start date logistics
- Thank everyone involved in the process
- Stop negotiating once you've accepted — start strong
