# Networking Strategies

## The Reality

~70% of jobs are filled through networking. Not because the system is broken — because hiring managers prefer candidates who come recommended by people they trust.

**Networking isn't schmoozing.** It's building genuine professional relationships. Give value. Be interested. Stay in touch.

## Informational Interviews

The most underused tool in job searching.

### What It Is
A 20-30 minute conversation where you learn about someone's role, company, or industry. You're NOT asking for a job — you're learning.

### How to Request One
> "Hi [Name], I'm exploring roles in [area] and noticed your background in [specific thing]. Would you have 20 minutes for a quick conversation about your experience at [Company]? I'd really value your perspective."

### During the Conversation
- Ask about their career path and what they enjoy
- Ask about challenges in their role/industry
- Ask what skills matter most for success
- Ask about the company culture
- DON'T ask for a job directly

### After
- Send a thank-you within 24 hours
- Reference something specific from the conversation
- If they offered to connect you with someone, follow up on that
- Stay in touch — share relevant articles, congratulate on milestones

### The Hidden Benefit
When a role opens up, you're the person they think of. "I know someone who'd be great for this."

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Profile Optimization
- **Headline:** Not just your title. "[Role] | [Specialty] | [Value you bring]"
- **About section:** Your career story in first person. What you do, what drives you, what you're looking for.
- **Experience:** Mirror your resume with rich descriptions
- **Skills:** Include keywords from your target job descriptions
- **Recommendations:** 3-5 from managers, colleagues, or clients
- **Activity:** Engage with content — comment thoughtfully, share industry insights

### Outreach
- **Connect with purpose** — always include a personalized note
- **Engage before asking** — comment on their posts, share their content
- **Be specific** — "I noticed you transitioned from consulting to product at [Company]" > "I'd love to connect"
- **Keep it short** — 3-4 sentences max for initial outreach

### Content
- Share industry insights and career learnings
- Comment thoughtfully on others' posts (adds visibility)
- Publish occasional articles on topics you're expert in
- Consistency beats virality — weekly engagement > one big post

## Building Your Network

### Who to Connect With
- **Warm connections:** Former colleagues, classmates, friends of friends
- **Industry peers:** People in your field at target companies
- **Hiring managers:** People who'd hire for your target role
- **Recruiters:** Specialize in your industry/function
- **Community members:** Meetup groups, Slack channels, professional orgs

### Maintaining Relationships
- **Regular touchpoints** — congratulate on new roles, share relevant content
- **Be helpful** — introduce people, share job postings, offer expertise
- **Follow up** — after meeting someone, connect within 48 hours
- **Keep notes** — record where you met, what you discussed, what they care about

## Recruiter Relationships

### Types
- **Internal recruiters:** Work for one company, fill their roles
- **Agency recruiters:** Work with multiple companies, earn commission
- **Executive recruiters:** Senior/specialized roles, relationship-driven

### Working With Recruiters
- Be responsive — speed matters in their world
- Be honest about your situation, timeline, and expectations
- Ask about the company and role details before committing to interviews
- You can work with multiple recruiters, but be transparent about it
- They work for the company, not for you — but aligned interests usually work out

## Networking Mistakes
1. **Only networking when you need a job** — build relationships before you need them
2. **All ask, no give** — relationships are two-way
3. **Generic outreach** — "I'd love to pick your brain" makes people cringe
4. **No follow-up** — one conversation isn't a relationship
5. **Being transactional** — people can tell. Be genuine.
